# Autonomous LLM Agent Implementation

## Overview
Your LinkedIn Jobs Skills Analyzer has been upgraded to operate as a fully autonomous agent using the ReAct (Reason and Act) framework. The agent now acts independently without requiring human confirmation for any actions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced System Instruction
- **Autonomous Framework**: Updated the system instruction to emphasize autonomous operation
- **Explicit Directives**: Added clear rules that the agent should never ask for confirmation
- **Continuous Cycles**: Instructions for continuous Thought→Action→Observation cycles
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic error handling and retry logic

### 2. Tool Configuration
```python
tool_config={'function_calling_config': {'mode': 'AUTO'}}
```
- Enabled automatic tool calling mode in Gemini
- Agent will automatically select and use appropriate tools

### 3. Autonomous Prompt Enhancement
The chat method now sends an enhanced prompt that explicitly activates autonomous mode:
```
AUTONOMOUS AGENT ACTIVATION:
User Request: {user_message}

Instructions: You are now operating as a fully autonomous agent. Follow the ReAct framework:
1. THINK about what the user needs
2. ACT by using tools immediately without asking permission  
3. OBSERVE the results and continue until complete
4. Provide comprehensive analysis and insights
5. End by calling print_message with your final answer, then end_session

Remember: NO CONFIRMATIONS NEEDED. Act immediately and autonomously.
```

### 4. New Features Added

#### Verbose Mode
- Toggle with `verbose on/off` commands
- Shows the agent's internal reasoning process
- Helpful for debugging and understanding ReAct cycles

#### Enhanced Main Loop
- Better session management for autonomous operation
- Special commands support (`help`, `verbose on/off`)
- Improved error handling and recovery

#### Session Management
- Automatic session reset after task completion
- Detection of agent-initiated session endings
- Continuous operation support

## How It Works

### ReAct Framework Implementation
1. **Thought**: Agent analyzes the user request and plans actions
2. **Action**: Agent immediately uses tools (database queries, analysis functions) without asking permission
3. **Observation**: Agent processes tool results and determines next steps
4. **Repeat**: Continues cycle until task is complete
5. **Finalize**: Calls `print_message` with results, then `end_session`

### Example Autonomous Flow
```
User: "What are the top Python skills?"
→ Agent Thought: Need to query database for Python-related job skills
→ Agent Action: query_database with SQL to find Python skills
→ Agent Observation: Got results, analyze patterns
→ Agent Action: Additional queries if needed for deeper analysis
→ Agent Observation: Compile comprehensive insights
→ Agent Action: print_message with formatted results
→ Agent Action: end_session
```

## Usage

### Running the Autonomous Agent
```bash
python test.py
```

### Available Commands
- **Regular queries**: Ask any question about job skills
- **`verbose on`**: Enable detailed ReAct process visibility
- **`verbose off`**: Disable verbose output
- **`help`**: Show available commands
- **`exit`**: Quit the application

### Testing Autonomous Behavior
```bash
python test_autonomous.py
```

## Key Benefits

1. **No Human Intervention Required**: Agent acts immediately without confirmations
2. **Intelligent Tool Usage**: Automatically selects appropriate tools and queries
3. **Error Recovery**: Handles failures and retries automatically
4. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Provides thorough insights and recommendations
5. **Session Management**: Properly manages conversation flow and endings

## Technical Details

### System Requirements
- Google Gemini API access
- Python 3.7+
- Required dependencies: `google-generativeai`, `pandas`, `psycopg2`, `python-dotenv`

### Configuration
- API key must be set in `.env` file as `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Database connection configured in `psycopg_query.py`
- Tool functions imported from `skills_analyzer.py`

## Best Practices

### For Users
- Ask clear, specific questions about job skills and trends
- Use `verbose on` when you want to see the agent's reasoning
- The agent will work through complex multi-step analyses automatically

### For Developers
- The agent is configured to be persistent and will retry failed operations
- Session state is managed automatically
- Conversation history is maintained for context

## Troubleshooting

### If the Agent Doesn't Act Autonomously
1. Check that `tool_config={'function_calling_config': {'mode': 'AUTO'}}` is set
2. Verify the system instruction emphasizes autonomous behavior
3. Ensure API key is properly configured
4. Use `verbose on` to see internal processing

### If Database Queries Fail
- Agent will automatically analyze errors and retry with corrections
- Multiple retry attempts are built into the system
- Check database connection and schema if persistent failures occur

## Future Enhancements

- Multi-agent collaboration support
- Long-term memory for conversation context
- Advanced error recovery strategies
- Performance optimization for large datasets
